# üè† home-ops

My monorepo project for the homelab with a focus on using GitOps practices with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to learn new tools and tech.

## üìñ Docs

At some point I'm going clean up the chicken scratch notes markdown files in [docs/](docs) and render them in some fancy way. The focus for now is getting k3s up.
